Neural machine translation system
Machine translation is a challenging task that traditionally involves large statistical models developed using highly sophisticated linguistic knowledge.

Neural machine translation is the use of deep neural networks for the problem of machine translation. In this project , we will discover how to develop a neural machine translation system for translating German phrases to English.

Loading the dataset
I uploaded my dataset ( text file "deu.txt" ) in my google drive, i make it public because its size exceeds the size limit allowed by github (25MB) and during the runtime of this notebook on google colab I load it in colab system space

URL of dataset file : https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1LYw_wl5ftE4ejhFPFpfar4lt1HvNKZgN

Visit this website : http://www.manythings.org/anki/ if you want to try more dataset of Bilingual Sentence Pairs they all have the same structure ( Tab-delimited Bilingual Sentence Pairs )
