# observation
this work is a collaboration with my friend Mohammed Hiddouche. I collaborated with him for his project [Neural machine translation system](https://github.com/hiddouche/NLP) !  


# predict tags on StackOverflow with linear models
I worked Me and  Mohammed Hiddouche in the both projects :Predict tags on StackOverflow with linear models and Neural machine translation system .
